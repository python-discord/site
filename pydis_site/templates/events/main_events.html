            <p>Once a year we host a code jam for members of our server to participate in. The code jam is an event where we place you in a team with 5 other random server members. You then have 11 days to code some sort of application or program in Python. Your program must use the specified technology/framework and incorporate the theme chosen by the server.</p>

            <p>An advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like, including Python. The puzzles start off easy and gradually get more difficult, all while revealing a fun little story that is appropriate for some seasons more than others. Puzzles are posted every day as they come, and you'll be able to discuss your solutions for each puzzle in dedicated threads.</p>

            <p>In 2022 for instance, we came up with <a href="https://peps.pythondiscord.com/pep-9001/">PEP 9001</a>, "The Final Style Guide for Python", <a href="https://peps.pythondiscord.com/pep-2241/">PEP 2241</a>, "Back to the Past", and a revised Zen of Python which you can check out using the <code>&zen</code> command. The <code>&blurpify</code> command is also available after the event for members to experiment with the style guide.</p>
