          </div>
        <p>Every year we hold a community-wide Summer Code Jam. For this event, members of our community are assigned to teams to collaborate and create something amazing using the technology we picked for them. One such technology that was picked for the Summer 2021 Code Jam was text user interfaces (TUIs), where teams could pick from a pre-approved list of frameworks.</p>
        <p>To help fuel the creative process, we provide a specific theme, like <strong>Think Inside the Box</strong> or <strong>Early Internet</strong>. At the end of the Code Jam, the projects are judged by Python Discord server staff members and guest judges from the larger Python community. The judges will consider creativity, code quality, teamwork, and adherence to the theme.</p>

                    For the past 15 years, <a href="https://pyweek.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PyWeek</a> has been running a bi-annual game jam for the
                    Python language. As of 2020, we are excited to say we are officially partnered with PyWeek to co-run these
                    events.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During each PyWeek event, we open a special discussion channel in which our members can discuss their
                    submissions, meet other participants, and talk to PyWeek staff. The PyWeek organizer,
                    Daniel Pope (<a href="https://twitter.com/lordmauve" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@lordmauve</a>) will be present during the entire event to answer
                    questions and post announcements and information in our community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike our other events, the <strong>community</strong> will select the winner from all the submissions
                    during PyWeek. We may release YouTube content showcasing the best submissions after the events are finished.

                    Each year, many of our members take part in an online coding competition called
                    The <a href="https://adventofcode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advent of Code</a> that takes place in December. Advent of Code is an
                    Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved
                    in any programming language you like, including Python.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the event, we will open a special discussion channel in which our members can discuss the puzzles
                    and compare their solutions. We will also open a private leaderboard and may even reward the best scoring
                    members on that board with prizes!
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, this event isn't purely competitive. You can also join in just to see how far you'll get, to
                    challenge yourself, as a way of learning Python, or just for the fun of it. In 2019, almost 200 members
                    signed up for our private leaderboard, but many more took on the challenge without focusing on the
                    competitive aspect.

                    The Game Jam is similar to our Code Jams but smaller in scope. Instead of having to complete a qualifier
                    and being teamed up with random strangers, members of our community can just sign-up individually or pair up
                    with whomever they like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The participants will have ten days to create a game using the technology we've selected, and drawing
                    inspiration from a provided theme. After the event, a panel of judges will play all the games and select a
                    winner. The top 5 will be featured in a special video on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQsrA4xo6jvdgsJZhKaBL6w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube channel</a>.
