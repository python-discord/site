# Staff Roles
#### Note regarding staff roles:
##### Q: How do I apply for Helper/Moderator/Admin?
There is no application, and there are no public nominations. Staff keep an eye out for potential candidates, and people nominated (by staff) are put in a pool for evaluation. After a period of time the candidate for a certain role is voted on by staff higher up the hierarchy.

##### Q: How do I become Helper?
See the description of a Helper. Being active in helping others, providing good help, contributing to our projects, and abiding by our rules go a long way towards catching staff attention, and make the server a better place for both beginners and advanced Python devs.

##### Role Expectations
In addition to the informal descriptions below, we've also written down a more formal list of expectations that come with each staff role. While this list is mostly for internal use, you can read it [here](/pages/server-info/staff-role-expectations/).

### <span class="fas fa-circle" style="color:#f85950"></span> Owners
**Description:** Owners of the server.

### <span class="fas fa-circle" style="color:#ff784d"></span> Admins
**Description:** Staff who administrate the server, its function, its staff, and are involved in deciding the direction of the server.

### <span class="fas fa-circle" style="color:#1abc9c"></span> Domain Leads
**Description:** Staff in charge of a certain domain such as moderation, events, and outreach. A lead will have a second role specifying their domain.

### <span class="fas fa-circle" style="color:#8dc2ba"></span> Project Leads
**Description:** Staff in charge of a certain project that require special attention, such as a YouTube video series or our new forms page.

### <span class="fas fa-circle" style="color:#ff9f1b"></span> Moderators
**Description:** Staff who moderate the server, enforce the rules, and coordinate with staff to support the server.

### <span class="fas fa-circle" style="color:#a1d1ff"></span> PyDis Core Developers
**Description:** A role for staff who are critical contributors to the server's core projects, like the [bot](https://github.com/python-discord/bot) and the [site](https://github.com/python-discord/site), and are in charge of managing the repositories.

### <span class="fas fa-circle" style="color:#a1d1ff"></span> DevOps
**Description:** A role for staff involved with the DevOps toolchain of our core projects.

### <span class="fas fa-circle" style="color:#f8d188"></span> Project Teams
**Description:** Staff can join teams which work on specific projects in the organisation, such as our code jams, media projects, and more.

### <span class="fas fa-circle" style="color:#eecd36"></span> Helpers
**Description:** This is the core staff role in our organization: All staff members have the Helpers role.

In general, being a helper means that you provide substantial help for the server's function, and have a good understanding of the culture and rules of the server.

Helpers assist in the help channels, demonstrate proficiency in the language, and have strong teaching and explanation skills.
Otherwise they might assist in other areas of the organization, such as being a core developer, events team member, or moderator.

Being a helper is also more than just quantity of messages, it's about quality. We watch and we pick these people out of the crowd, because we believe that they're a valuable asset to the community, and want our users to know that they're someone that can be relied on for answers and help.
