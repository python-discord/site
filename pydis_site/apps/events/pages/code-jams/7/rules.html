        <li><p>Your solution must use the Django framework. It is not permitted to circumvent this rule by e.g. using Django as a wrapper for another framework.</p></li>
        <li><p>Your solution should be platform agnostic. For example, if you use filepaths in your submission, use <code>pathlib</code> to create platform agnostic Path objects instead of hardcoding the paths.</p></li>
        <li><p>Your project should be a web app which can be run in a <em>standard web browser</em>.</p></li>
        <li>
            <p>
                You must document precisely how to install and run your project.
                This should be as easy as possible, which means you should consider using dependency managers like <code>pipenv</code>, and <code>npm</code>.
                We would also encourage you to use <code>docker</code> and <code>docker-compose</code> to containerize your project, but this isn't a requirement.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            You must get contributions from every member of your team, if you have an issue with someone on your team please contact a member of the administration team.
            These contributions do not necessarily have to be code, for example it's absolutely fine for someone to contribute management, documentation, graphics or audio.
            <strong>
                Team members that do not contribute will be removed from the Code Jam, and will not receive their share of any prizes the team may win.
                They may also be barred from entering future events.
            </strong>
        </li>
        <li><p>You must use GitHub as source control.</p></li>
        <li>
            <p>
                All code and assets must be compatible with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT license</a>.
                This is because we will be merging your submission into our <code>summer-code-jam-2020</code> repo at the end of the jam,
                and this repo is licensed with the MIT license.
                <strong>Projects that include assets that are incompatible with this license may be disqualified.</strong>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><p>All code must be written and committed within the time constrictions of the jam. Late commits may be reverted, so make sure you leave enough time to bug test your program.</p></li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Use English as the main language for your project, including names, comments, documentation, and commit messages.
                The text displayed in your web application should also be in English,
                although you are allowed to provide the user with options for internationalisation and translation.
            </p>
