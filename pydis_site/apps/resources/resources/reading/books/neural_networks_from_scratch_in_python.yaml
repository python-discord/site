description: '"Neural Networks From Scratch" is a book intended to teach you how to build neural networks on your own,
  without any libraries, so you can better understand deep learning and how all of the elements work.
  This is so you can go out and do new/novel things with deep learning as well as to become more successful with even more basic models.
  This book is to accompany the usual free tutorial videos and sample code from youtube.com/sentdex.
