description: This fast-paced, thorough introduction to programming with Python will have you writing programs,
  solving problems, and making things that work in no time.
  In the first half of the book, you’ll learn basic programming concepts, such as variables, lists, classes, and loops,
  and practice writing clean code with exercises for each topic.
  You’ll also learn how to make your programs interactive and test your code safely before adding it to a project.
  In the second half, you’ll put your new knowledge into practice with three substantial projects:
  a Space Invaders–inspired arcade game, a set of data visualizations with Python’s handy libraries,
  and a simple web app you can deploy online.
