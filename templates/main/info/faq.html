                            How you get started with Python is very much going to depend on your prior programming
                            experience. If you're already an experienced programmer, you should should have no
                            trouble following pretty much any guide out there - but for true beginners, we recommend
                            full-on tutorials such as Automate the Boring Stuff with Python.

                            Generally, we're always going to recommend that people new to Python start with Python 3.
                            There's a few reasons for this:

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Python 3 is the latest-and-greatest version. It gets all the new features and is in
                                active development.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Python 2 lacks many features available in Python 3 and is mechanically different in a
                                few important areas.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Python 2 is being sunset and will reach its end of life in 2020. It will not be
                                maintained past 2020. There will be no Python 2.8.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Most libraries now fully support Python 3, and many are dropping or have dropped support
                                for Python 2.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            The only reason a user may want to stick with Python 2 is if they are stuck working a job
                            with a legacy codebase that cannot or will not be updated to work with Python 3. To users
                            in those situations: Commiserations.

                            If you're a beginner, you should not be using an IDE. This is because IDEs do a lot of
                            basic things automatically where a beginner should learn to do things themselves - for
                            example, some IDEs can generate huge chunks of code or catch beginner errors without you
                            even noticing you'd made a typo.

                                    If not, have you installed it? If the module <a href="https://pypi.org/search/">is on PyPi</a>,
                                    you can install it using pip in a terminal: <code>pip install module_name</code>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If you think you've installed it, try upgrading it with pip in a terminal:
                                    <code>pip install -U module_name</code> - Make sure there were no errors during
                                    installation

                                    If all else fails, make sure you've read the module documentation fully, and ensure
                                    that you're following it correctly

                                    Make sure you check this when you install python. If you forgot to do that the
                                    first time, then the easiest way to solve this problem is to reinstall Python

                                    If you're on Windows, there's a good chance that <code>python</code> and
                                    <code>pip</code> aren't what you actually need to run! Some options you could
                                    try include <code>py -3</code>, <code>python3</code> or <code>python36</code> - if
                                    one of these works, then you should be able to use <code>py -3 -m pip</code>,
                                    <code>pip3</code> or <code>pip36</code> as well
                                </li>

                                    If you're on a Mac, Python comes with the OS - however, it's quite likely to be
                                    an old version. You can solve this by using <a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew</a>

                                is known as the official Python style guide. It sets out a lot of very clear guidelines
                                which help you structure your code.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One of the most useful things you can do when writing your code is to follow a style
                                guide. It makes it easier to read your code overall, but a consistent style guide
                                is very important as it means that everyone that contributes to your project is
                                writing code in the same style - meaning everyone will be able to read it. As PEP
                                itself reads: "A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds".
                            </p>

                                PEP8 isn't the only style guide available to you, but it is the most widely used
                                and best-understood of them - and for that reason, we do recommend you use it. That
                                said,

                                In our opinion, yes it is. It's a very powerful language, but it will force you to
                                write readable code and it's designed to allow you to write code very quickly, without
