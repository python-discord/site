                    privacy policy on the Discord server. You will have had the opportunity to leave the server if
                    you weren't happy with it. If you decided to stay, then we will consider you to have accepted
                    our use of your data, as detailed on this page.

                    If you joined the community after the <strong>20th of May, 2018</strong>, you will have been greeted with the
                    <code>#checkpoint</code> channel. In this channel, you must run the <code>self.accept()</code>
                    command to signify that you accept both our rules and this privacy policy. This will also have been
                    detailed in a message in that channel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note that your acceptance of this privacy policy is retroactive, and you agree that any
                    revisions to it will apply when they are published. We will attempt to keep everyone updated on
                    changes to this policy via the usual announcement channels - if at any point you are not happy with
                    a change to the privacy policy, please bring it up with a member of staff. If we're unable to
                    solve your issue in a satisfactory way, you may remove your data as detailed below.

                                    Once you've left the Discord server, your data is removed automatically. Please note that
                                    for the sake of data integrity and moderation purposes, we do not remove your Discord
                                    user ID from our database - but we do anonymize your data as far as possible.

                    Under the terms specified above, we do aim to comply with GDPR. While we do not currently have

                <p>
                    We believe that the best way to keep your personal data safe is to avoid collecting it at all.
                    Discord itself is GDPR-compliant and they've already done the legwork required to ensure that
                    your data may be collected - so we don't see the need to collect your personal information
                    ourselves. Don't forget that by using Discord, you are stating that you are of legal age in
                    your country to give consent to process your data!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are currently working on an automated way to get all of your data in both a human-readable
                    and machine-readable format. Keep your eye on the usual announcements channels for more information
                    on that, as it happens.
