                    If you joined the community on or before the <strong>20th of May, 2018</strong>, you will have seen an announcement about our
                    privacy policy on the Discord server. You will have had the opportunity to leave the server if
                    you weren't happy with it. If you decided to stay, then we will consider you to have accepted
                    our use of your data, as detailed on this page.

                    If you joined the community after the <strong>20th of May, 2018</strong>, you will have been greeted with the
                    <code>#checkpoint</code> channel. In this channel, you must run the <code>!accept</code>
                    command to signify that you accept both our rules and this privacy policy. This will also have been
                    detailed in a message in that channel.

                <p>
                    Please note that your acceptance of this privacy policy is retroactive, and you agree that any
                    revisions to it will apply when they are published. We will attempt to keep everyone updated on
                    changes to this policy via the usual announcement channels - if at any point you are not happy with
                    a change to the privacy policy, please bring it up with a member of staff. If we're unable to
                    solve your issue in a satisfactory way, you may remove your data as detailed below.

                    We believe that the best way to keep your personal data safe is to avoid collecting it at all.
                    Discord itself is GDPR-compliant and they've already done the legwork required to ensure that
                    your data may be collected - so we don't see the need to collect your personal information
                    ourselves. Don't forget that by using Discord, you are stating that you are of legal age in
                    your country to give consent to process your data!

                    on that, as it happens.

                            As we're replacing Rowboat (the bot we use for moderation), we need to hold onto some of
                            your data - even after you've left the server. This is necessary to ensure the smooth
                            running and security of our community.
                        </p>

                            While we don't collect your email addresses, they are visible on GitLab if you email an
                            issue directly to our <code>meta@</code> email address, but only to staff.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We no longer collect GitHub usernames - instead, we collect GitLab usernames. Additionally,
                            we now collect user avatar URLs for display purposes.
                        </p>

                            Rectified an omission in the old privacy policy, where the system information you provide
                            as part of a code jam signup wasn't mentioned.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We no longer collect your date of birth, and all collected dates of birth have been
                            removed from our database. The reason for this is that Discord itself already complies with
                            GDPR - and in order for you to sign up for a code jam, you must already have a Discord
                            account.

                            Completed the first version of our privacy policy. We also updated our OAuth scopes for
                            Discord logins - we no longer collect your email, or get the access to join you to servers
                            automatically. All collected emails have also been removed from the database.
